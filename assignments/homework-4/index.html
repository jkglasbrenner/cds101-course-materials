  <h1 class="static-page-title">Homework&nbsp;4</h1>
</header><div class="static-page-body">
  <h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>The first part of this page explains how homework assignments will be handled and evaluated, since they are completed in groups. The questions for Homework 4 start further down, <a href="#the-national-survey-of-family-growth-dataset">click this link to skip to that part of the page</a>.</p>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>As a group, solve the homework problems and write your answers in the R Markdown file <span class="monospace">homework_4.Rmd</span>. Grades for the group submissions will, in addition to correctness, be based on document formatting, visualization quality, writing quality, and code style. <strong>This means that your group submission is to be written in the style of a exploratory data report,&nbsp;meaning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Each exercise must be written up using full sentences such that it is clear what question is being&nbsp;answered.</p></li>
<li><p>There needs to be plain text above each code block explaining what you are doing, and the code blocks should be&nbsp;organized.</p></li>
<li><p>The R Markdown file <strong>must</strong> knit without error and generate a <span class="caps">PDF</span> file, and the final <span class="caps">PDF</span> output must look nice, clean, and be easy to&nbsp;read.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="participation">Participation</h3>
<p>Credit for group participation will be determined using the following&nbsp;sources:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A <span class="monospace"><span class="caps">CONTRIBUTIONS</span>.md</span> file distributed with your group&nbsp;repository</p></li>
<li><p>Commit history on&nbsp;GitHub</p></li>
<li><p>Discussion history in your group’s private Slack&nbsp;channel</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Each group will need to fill out the <span class="monospace"><span class="caps">CONTRIBUTIONS</span>.md</span> file as part of their submission.</strong> This file is where where each group member lists what he or she contributed to the final submission. Read the section <strong><a href="#fill-out-the-contributions.md-file">Fill out the <span class="monospace"><span class="caps">CONTRIBUTIONS</span>.md</span> file</a></strong> for more details on how this&nbsp;works.</p>
<h4 id="google-docs">Google&nbsp;Docs</h4>
<p>If your group used an external document to coordinate and organize your work, such as a Google Doc, then that can also count as evidence of participation, <strong>provided that there is a visible writing history and it is possible to identify which student is responsible for each edit.</strong> This will require you to share the relevant file with the instructor with full privileges on the document so that it’s possible to review the document’s editing history. Please note that anonymous edits to Google Docs documents cannot be used as participation evidence, since there is no way to verify the account responsible for the added content. Also, for similar reasons, offline documents traded back and forth via email cannot be accepted as evidence of&nbsp;participation.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-answer-the-questions-as-a-group">How to answer the questions as a&nbsp;group</h3>
<p>The following is a checklist you may follow to help you get started with answering the questions as a&nbsp;group:</p>
<div class="no-bullets">
<ul>
<li><p><i class="far fa-square" data=fa=transform="grow-8"></i>  Read through all the problems individually. Then, as a group, discuss what will be needed to fully answer each&nbsp;question.</p></li>
<li><p><i class="far fa-square" data=fa=transform="grow-8"></i>  As a group, decide how you will split up writing responsibilities. A typical way to do this is to have each group member be responsible for writing out the full answer to a certain number of&nbsp;questions.</p></li>
<li><p><i class="far fa-square" data=fa=transform="grow-8"></i>  <strong>(Important)</strong> Before you start, make a copy of <span class="monospace">homework_4.Rmd</span> and <strong>rename the copied file</strong> to include your last name. For example, if your last name is Smith, then your file copy should be renamed to <span class="monospace">homework_4_smith.Rmd</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><i class="far fa-square" data=fa=transform="grow-8"></i>  Commit and push your copied file to&nbsp;GitHub.</p></li>
<li><i class="far fa-square" data=fa=transform="grow-8"></i>  Draft your contributions in <strong>your</strong> file. For example, if my last name was Smith and I agreed to write-up the answers to questions 4, 5, and 6, then I would open up <span class="monospace">homework_4_smith.Rmd</span> and put my answers there. When I’m done, I would save my file, then commit and push my work to&nbsp;GitHub.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 id="how-to-edit-and-merge-your-answers-into-the-group-submission">How to edit and merge your answers into the group&nbsp;submission</h3>
<p>While you will be writing your answers in separate files, eventually the group will need to merge in everyone’s answers into the main <span class="monospace">homework_4.Rmd</span> document. The following checklist may help with&nbsp;this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><i class="far fa-square" data=fa=transform="grow-8"></i>  Select an editor to be in charge of merging everyone’s answers into the final document <span class="monospace">homework_4.Rmd</span>. Because the editor needs to prepare the document for submission, it is reasonable if he or she contributes slightly less in terms of answering the questions (for example, if everyone else answers three questions, it would be okay if the editor answers&nbsp;two).</p></li>
<li><p><i class="far fa-square" data=fa=transform="grow-8"></i>  The editor should ensure that everyone has committed and pushed their answers to GitHub so they can copy and paste in each&nbsp;contribution.</p></li>
<li><p><i class="far fa-square" data=fa=transform="grow-8"></i>  The editor needs to make sure that the final submission reads like a coherent document and that the writing style and code style are uniform across all the answers. In other words, it should read like a single person answered all the questions, not a group of four&nbsp;people.</p></li>
<li><p><i class="far fa-square" data=fa=transform="grow-8"></i>  The editor will be in charge of of committing and pushing the final R Markdown file to GitHub, knitting to <span class="caps">PDF</span>, and uploading the <span class="caps">PDF</span> file on&nbsp;Blackboard.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fill-out-the-contributions.md-file">Fill out the <span class="monospace"><span class="caps">CONTRIBUTIONS</span>.md</span>&nbsp;file</h3>
<p>After everything is written up and ready for submission, the last thing the group will need to do is fill out the <span class="monospace"><span class="caps">CONTRIBUTIONS</span>.md</span> file. By default, the file looks like&nbsp;this:</p>
<pre class="markdown"><code># Contributions to group submission

## Editor: FirstName LastName Member 1

*   Questions answered:

## FirstName LastName Member 2

*   Questions answered:

## FirstName LastName Member 3

*   Questions answered:

## FirstName LastName Member 4

*   Questions answered:</code></pre>
<p>At a minimum, you must remove the <span class="monospace">FirstName LastName Member</span> entries in the template and fill in the names of the people in your group, indicate which group member served as the editor, and state which questions were written up by each&nbsp;member.</p>
<p>Additional information beyond this <strong>should</strong> be supplied, such as indicating when a group member helped another group member edit an answer or gave helpful comments in a Slack discussion. For example, one group member’s contribution list may read as&nbsp;follows:</p>
<pre class="markdown"><code>## Jane Smith

*   Questions answered: 4, 5, 6
*   Helped with editing on answers 8 and 9
*   Collaborated with group member Jack Williams on answering question 10
*   Pointed out spelling errors and suggested fixes to the document layout in the merged group document</code></pre>
<h3 id="working-with-a-github-repository-as-a-group">Working with a GitHub repository as a&nbsp;group</h3>
<p>You will likely encounter some issues while working in a group-based GitHub repository. In particular, you might find that when you click <em>“Push”</em> in the <strong>Git</strong> tab of RStudio, that it doesn’t seem to work and instead you get an annoying error message! This will happen when another member of your group has uploaded work before you did. While this can be irritating to deal with, this is actually a good thing, as it is GitHub’s way of protecting your files from accidential overwrites and&nbsp;deletions.</p>
<p>So what should you do to keep things running smoothly? First, <strong>always</strong> work in your own file, never in another person’s file. If you are not the editor, then you should not edit <span class="monospace">homework_4.Rmd</span> either! Also, do not remove or rename any files that are not your own. Finally, when you are getting ready to work, following the procedure below should help keep the error messages to a&nbsp;minimum:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>When you start working, you should begin by going to the <strong>Git</strong> tab and clicking <em>“Pull”</em> (notice this is not the same as <em>“Push”</em>). This will synchronize any new changes that your group may have made into your&nbsp;files.</p></li>
<li><p>Work on your file as normal. When you have completed your work, save your&nbsp;file.</p></li>
<li><p>Now we want to commit. <strong>But first</strong>, go to the <strong>Git</strong> tab and click <em>“Pull”</em> one more time to check for any other changes. Then, still in the <strong>Git</strong> tab, click the checkmark next to your updated file, type a message in the messagebox, and click the <strong>Commit</strong>&nbsp;button.</p></li>
<li><p>If the updated file is no longer in the list of files in the <strong>Git</strong> tab, then your commit was&nbsp;successful.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <em>“Push”</em> to upload your changed&nbsp;file.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="if-the-above-advice-doesnt-work">If the above advice doesn’t&nbsp;work…</h4>
<p>If, even after following the advice below, you still encounter error messages when Pulling from and Pushing to GitHub, contact the course instructor for&nbsp;help.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-submit">How to&nbsp;submit</h3>
<p>The editor should follow the steps below to submit the homework for his/her&nbsp;group.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Make sure that everyone has committed and pushed their R Markdown files so that everything is synchronized to GitHub. If you do this right, then you will be able to view all the completed files on the GitHub&nbsp;website.</p></li>
<li><p>Knit your group’s R Markdown document to the <span class="caps">PDF</span> format, export (download) the <span class="caps">PDF</span> file from RStudio Server, and then upload it to <em>Homework 4</em> posting on&nbsp;Blackboard.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="market-value-of-condominiums-in-new-york-city-dataset">Market value of condominiums in New York City&nbsp;dataset</h2>
<p>This dataset reports on the market valuations of condominiums in New York City for Fiscal Year 2011/2012. The data<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> comes from the New York City Department of Finance and was made available to the general public on the <a href="https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/"><span class="caps">NYC</span> OpenData website</a> (<a href="https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/" class="uri">https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/</a>), which was subsequently <a href="https://www.jaredlander.com/data/">cleaned and aggregated version by data scientist Jared Lander</a> (<a href="https://www.jaredlander.com/data" class="uri">https://www.jaredlander.com/data</a>). The official description for the dataset is as&nbsp;follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Condominiums and cooperatives are valued as if they were residential rental apartments. Income information from similar rental properties is applied to determine value. The Department of Finance (<span class="caps">DOF</span>) chooses similar properties to value condos and coops. Properties are selected based on a combination of factors such as: land location, income levels, building age and construction and exemptions and&nbsp;subsidies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The driving question for our analysis as&nbsp;follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are key factors that affect the overall price of condominiums in New York&nbsp;City?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, your main goal is to build a linear regression model that predicts the market value per squarefoot—the variable <span class="monospace">value_per_sqft</span>—of condominiums in New York City. Note that you are not expected to find a regression model with 100% precision, instead our interest is in using models to uncover trends in the&nbsp;data.</p>
<p>When building and evaluating predictive models, it is standard protocol to split your dataset into a <strong>training dataset</strong> and a <strong>test dataset</strong>. This has already been done for you, with the training dataset loaded into the variable <span class="monospace">housing_train</span> and the testing dataset loaded into <span class="monospace">housing_test</span>. You will be using <span class="monospace">housing_train</span> for most of the homework to build and cross-validate your models. Once you’ve selected your model, as a final step you will use it to predict the <span class="monospace">value_per_sqft</span> column in the dataset stored in <span class="monospace">housing_test</span>.</p>
<p>The dataset contains the 7 variables listed&nbsp;below.</p>

<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
<ol class="example" type="1">
<li><p>Create the following visualizations to explore the&nbsp;dataset:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A histogram of <span class="monospace">value_per_sqft</span> faceted over boroughs of New York&nbsp;City</p></li>
<li><p>Box plots of <span class="monospace">units</span> (y axis) for the different boroughs (x axis) plotted two different ways: in a normal scale and in a <code>log10()</code> scale along the y axis (see <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/graphics-for-communication.html#replacing-a-scale" class="uri">http://r4ds.had.co.nz/graphics-for-communication.html#replacing-a-scale</a> for how to scale the&nbsp;axes)</p></li>
<li><p>Box plots of <span class="monospace">sqft</span> (y axis) for the different boroughs (x axis) plotted two different ways: in a normal scale and in a <code>log10()</code> scale along the y&nbsp;axis</p></li>
<li><p>Scatterplots of <span class="monospace">value_per_sqft</span> (y axis) versus <span class="monospace">units</span> (x axis) using <code>log10()</code> scaling for <span class="monospace">units</span>. Facet over two variables: boroughs <strong>and</strong> condominium&nbsp;classification.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Based on your plots so far, which variables (columns) in the dataset seem to have the strongest overall impact on the condominium&nbsp;values?</p></li>
<li><p>The box plots of <span class="monospace">units</span> in the previous question should reveal extreme outliers in the plot. Since our goal is to model general trends and not precise values, fitting to these data points may skew our model in an unhelpful way. Filter the dataset to remove these outliers (there are 3 in&nbsp;all).</p></li>
<li><p>Build 4 different univariate (single variable) linear regression models using <span class="monospace">value_per_sqft</span> as your response variable and either <span class="monospace">boro</span>, <span class="monospace">class</span>, <span class="monospace">units</span>, or <span class="monospace">sqft</span> as your explanatory variable. Plug these models into the k-fold cross-validation function <code>rep_kfold_cv()</code> and use <span class="monospace">k = 10</span> and <span class="monospace">cv_reps = 3</span> as your other inputs. Compare the mean-square error (<span class="caps">MSE</span>), both unadjusted and adjusted, and <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> for these different models, noting that models with better predictive power will have lower <span class="caps">MSE</span> and higher <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> scores. Which model did the best so&nbsp;far?</p></li>
<li><p>Build and cross-validate at least 3 multivariate models that predict <span class="monospace">value_per_sqft</span>, using the k-fold cross-validation parameters <span class="monospace">k = 10</span> and <span class="monospace">cv_reps = 3</span>. An example of a multivariate model is <span class="monospace">value_per_sqft ~ boro + units</span>. You may also want to consider including interaction terms (see <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-basics.html#interactions-continuous-and-categorical" class="uri">http://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-basics.html#interactions-continuous-and-categorical</a> for a quick review). For example, you might try <span class="monospace">value_per_sqft ~ boro + class * sqft</span>. Which of your models performs the best? Is it significantly better than your best model in the last&nbsp;question?</p></li>
<li><p>Now that you’ve selected your model, train it on the full&nbsp;dataset:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>final_model &lt;- lm(model_formula, data = housing_train) </code></pre>
<p>where <span class="monospace">model_formula</span> is the best performing model from the previous question. Use <span class="monospace">final_model</span> to calculate the mean-square error for predictions on the <em>testing</em>&nbsp;dataset:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>final_model %&gt;%
  mse(housing_test)</code></pre>
<p>This score is useful because it is absolute and allows you to compare how well your model performs against all other model types. Can you do better than a <span class="caps">MSE</span> score of&nbsp;2030.34?</p></li>
<li><p>To wrap up, evaluate how well your model obeys the conditions for least squares linear regression, which are summarized on page 238 of the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qCW5nnrPRde6OQatY1P6Y3l8KWv02sf4"><em>Introductory Statistics with Randomization and Simulation</em></a> textbook. Make two plots to inspect how well your model conforms to the requirements for linear&nbsp;regression:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To evaluate the residual spread, make a residual (y axis) versus predicted (x axis)&nbsp;scatterplot.</p></li>
<li><p>To evaluate whether the residual distribution is nearly normal, make a residual Q-Q&nbsp;plot.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Explain whether your model obeys the conditions for least squares linear&nbsp;regression.</p></li>
