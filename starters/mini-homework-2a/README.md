Alternatively, [`minihw02a_rmarkdown_practice_final_output.html`][rmarkdown-recreate-html] is what you should get if you knit to HTML instead of PDF.

## How to submit

To submit your assignment, follow the two steps below.
Your homework will be graded for credit **after** you've completed both steps!

1.  Save, commit, and push your completed R Markdown file so that everything is synchronized to GitHub.
    If you do this right, then you will be able to view your completed file on the GitHub website.

2.  Knit your R Markdown document to the PDF format, export (download) the PDF file from RStudio Server, and then upload it to *Mini-homework 2a* posting on Blackboard.
