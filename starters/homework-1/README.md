# Homework 1: The rail trail dataset

## Instructions

**Instructions and questions for homework 1 are available on the course website:** <https://www.cds101.com/assignments/homework-1/>

When you're ready to submit, follow the directions in the **[How to submit](#how-to-submit)** section below.

## How to submit

The editor should follow the instructions below to submit the homework for his/her group.

### Fill out the `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` file

After everything is written up and ready for submission, the last thing the group will need to do is fill out the `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` file.
By default, the file looks like this:

``` markdown
# Contributions to group submission

## Editor: FirstName LastName Member 1

*   Questions answered:

## FirstName LastName Member 2

*   Questions answered:

## FirstName LastName Member 3

*   Questions answered:

## FirstName LastName Member 4

*   Questions answered:
```

At a minimum, you must remove the `FirstName LastName Member` entries in the template and fill in the names of the people in your group, indicate which group member served as the editor, and state which questions were written up by each member.

Additional information beyond this **should** be supplied, such as indicating when a group member helped another group member edit an answer or gave helpful comments in a Slack discussion.
For example, one group member's contribution list may read as follows:

``` markdown
## Jane Smith

*   Questions answered: 4, 5, 6
*   Helped with editing on answers 8 and 9
*   Collaborated with group member Jack Williams on answering question 10
*   Pointed out spelling errors and suggested fixes to the document layout in the merged group document
```

### Push all files and upload knitted PDF

After confirming that the `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` file has been properly filled out, the editor should follow the two steps below.

1.  Make sure that everyone has committed and pushed their R Markdown files so that everything is synchronized to GitHub.
    If you do this right, then you will be able to view all the completed files on the GitHub website.

2.  Knit your group's R Markdown document to the PDF format, export (download) the PDF file from RStudio Server, and then upload it to *Homework 1* posting on Blackboard.
